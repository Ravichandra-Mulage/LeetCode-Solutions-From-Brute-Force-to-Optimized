## Approach 1: Brute Force - Check All Pairs

### Idea: For each element in the array, check if it is the largest and then verify if it is at least twice as large as every other element.

Steps:

1. Iterate through each element to find the largest element.

2. For each element, check if it is at least twice as large as all other elements.

3. Return the index of the largest element if the condition is met, otherwise return -1.

**Time Complexity: O(n^2)** - For each element, we check all other elements.

**Space Complexity: O(1)** - No extra space used.

## Approach 2: Find Max and Compare with Others

### Idea: First find the largest element, then compare it with all other elements to check the condition.

Steps:

1. Find the largest element and its index.

2. Iterate through the array and check if the largest element is at least twice as large as every other element.

3. Return the index if condition is met, else return -1.

**Time Complexity: O(n)** - Two passes through the array.


**Space Complexity: O(1)** - No extra space used.

## Approach 3: Track Largest and Second Largest

### Idea: The largest element must be at least twice as large as the second largest element to satisfy the condition.
Steps:

1. Traverse the array to find the largest and the second largest elements.

2. Check if the largest element is at least twice as large as the second largest.

3. Return the index of the largest element if the condition is met, else return -1.

**Time Complexity: O(n)** - Single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity: O(1)** - No extra space used.

## Approach 4: Optimized Single Pass

###Idea: Combine finding the largest and second largest elements in a single pass while checking the condition.

Steps:

1. Traverse the array while maintaining the largest and second largest elements.

2. During traversal, if any element is found that is more than half of the current largest, update the second largest.

3. After traversal, check the condition between the largest and second largest.

**Time Complexity: O(n)** - Single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity: O(1)** - No extra space used.

## Summary

### Approach 1 (Brute Force): Simple but inefficient, checks all pairs.

### Approach 2 (Find Max and Compare): Efficient with two passes.

### Approach 3 (Track Largest and Second Largest): More efficient with one pass.

### Approach 4 (Optimized Single Pass): Most efficient with a single pass and constant space.
