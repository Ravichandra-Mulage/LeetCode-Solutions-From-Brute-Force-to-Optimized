## 1. Brute Force Approach (Naive)

Time Complexity: O(n^2) (For each index, compute left and right sums)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Idea: For each index i, calculate the sum of elements to the left and right separately.

## 2. Prefix Sum with Constant Space

Time Complexity: O(n) (Two passes over the array)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Idea: Compute the total sum first, then traverse the array while maintaining a running left sum.

## 3. Two-Pointer Approach (Balanced)

Time Complexity: O(n) (Single pass over the array)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Idea: Use two pointers to dynamically adjust left and right sums while traversing the array.

## 4. Optimized Prefix Sum (Most Efficient)

Time Complexity: O(n) (Single pass over the array)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Idea: Traverse the array once while maintaining a running left sum and calculating the right sum on the fly.
