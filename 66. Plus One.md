## Approach 1: Iterative with Carry Handling

### Idea

Iterate from the end, increment digits, and handle carry without recursion.

## Time Complexity

**O(n) (optimal for most cases).**


## Approach 2: Optimal Iterative (Best for All Cases)

### Idea

Same as Approach 1, but written more concisely.

## Time Complexity

**O(n) (best approach, handles all cases efficiently).**
